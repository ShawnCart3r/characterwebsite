                <p class="character-blurb" >Persephone Prime is the ultimate evolution of the Nightmaric Virus, a relentless contagion that consumes and reshapes entire planes. Forged from the collective knowledge and power of countless conquered worlds, she now rules as a multiversal tyrant, the living embodiment of control and assimilation.

                    Her presence bends reality itself, enforcing her dominion through corrupted beings and infected planes. She controls her empire with a hive mind of unimaginable scale, turning resistance into subjugation and individuality into tools of her will.
                    
                    Persephone sees the multiverse as inherently flawed, chaotic, and inefficient. Through domination and eradication of dissent, she seeks to impose her vision of perfect order, rewriting existence in her image. Her conquest is methodical and inevitable, leaving entire worlds hollowed and folded into her domain.
                    
                    Her ambition is absolute: total control over the multiverse. Resistance is crushed, yet the infinite nature of the multiverse ensures that her work is never done—a flaw she cannot tolerate but is destined to face forever.

                <p class="character-blurb" >Persephone's Edict is the ultimate expression of Persephone Prime's control over the multiverse, a devastating sorcery that enforces submission through sheer dominance.

                    The spell forces all opponents to sacrifice their most valuable resources—permanents, cards, and life—while banishing pieces of their potential futures by exiling cards from their libraries. As her enemies are left in ruin, Persephone reclaims strength from their losses, resurrecting her power, restoring her vitality, and drawing on the infinite possibilities of her dominion.
                    
                    Designed for multiplayer chaos, this uncounterable command showcases Persephone's unyielding authority, delivering punishment that is absolute and inescapable. Persephone’s Edict is a declaration: she is the ruler of all existence, and defiance is futile. Learn more <a href="https://storied-centaur-91f14a.netlify.app/" target="_blank"> read here..</a></p>
